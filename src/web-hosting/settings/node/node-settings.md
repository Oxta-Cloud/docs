# Nodejs

In the Node.js Settings, you can change the Node.js Version and the App Port.

The App Port is used to forward NGINX traffic via reverse proxy to the Node App.

The Node.js Versions are managed via [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

**NODE.JS VERSION CHANGE**

After changing the Node.js Version, log out from an active SSH Session and connect again to see the new version.

Type: node -v to see the new version.
