# Python

In the Python Settings, you can change the Python Version and the App Port.

The App Port is used to forward NGINX traffic via reverse proxy to the Python App.

By default, the Python Version of the operating system is installed.

**PYTHON VERSION CHANGE**

After changing the Python Version, log out from an active SSH Session and connect again to see the new version.

Type: python --version to see the new version.
