# PHP

In the PHP Settings, you can change the PHP Version and change other settings like:

- memory_limit
- max_execution_time
- max_input_time
- max_input_vars
- post_max_size
- upload_max_filesize

The most common settings can be modified to your needs, but you can overwrite them in the
Additional Configuration Directives if you need to change other parameter values.
